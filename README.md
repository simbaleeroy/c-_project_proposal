** C++ Project Proposal **
Problem:
People have different personalities and different preferences but in general; they can be grouped into two: introverts, and extroverts. In my community specifically my apartment block I have noticed that people who live close/next to each other are so incompatible that it is hard to relate to each other let alone make friends. Sometimes the neighbor can decide to play music at a very high volume and if the others are to complain it would seem like they are trying to be controlling especially if they complain every day. At the end of the day some end up living uncomfortably because they cannot move out that easily because other apartments are ridiculously expensive.

Solution:
The solution I have thought about is to divide the block into four sections that is, Red Wing and White Wing, Blue Wing, and Green Wing. When people decide to look for an apartment in the block, they fill in an electronic form that asks personal questions. The information is then used to group people according to the similarities in personalities, those who are more alike get to live closer to each other. This is helpful because if people of them same personality live together, they will be able to relate to each other more easily, this results in a more united community and less quarrels among neighbors.
